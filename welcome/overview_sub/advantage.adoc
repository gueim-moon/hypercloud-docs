This chapter describes the main features of {product-title} and {product-version}.

== Kubernetes-based container platform with no vendor lock-in

{product-title} {product-version} aims for vendor-neutral PaaS platform that completely eliminates vendor and platform dependencies based on Kubernetes, the de facto standard in the market. There are no restrictions on the underlying infrastructure as it supports physical and virtual environments and all Linux-like OSs such as CentOS, Ubuntu, and RHEL. +

The Kubernetes version is always up-to-date, with a wealth of professionals who can control the engine level for Kubernetes, and all Kubernetes-based {product-title} {product-version} solutions are based on obtaining CK certification of CNCF.

== Standards-based hybrid-multicloud infrastructure support 

{Product-title} {product-version}, which is based on Kubernetes standards, is compatible with all cloud environments based on Kubernetes such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, and ensures optimal cluster scalability. +

Therefore, it is easy to build a cloud-native hybrid-multicloud infrastructure, and provides the following functions. 

* Cluster provisioning and monitoring through cluster APIs
* Multi-cluster integration and deployment with federation
* Multi-cluster integration and management through a unified console
* Source-to-Multicloud DevOps provided through CI/CD pipelines of {product-title} {product-version}

These features improve development productivity and sustainability even in a hybrid-multicloud environment, and ensure the convenience of operational management via a single control unit.

== Proven open source internalization and optimization

{product-title} {product-version} is a platform that not only configures the Kubernetes-based engine, but also internalizes the packages open sources optimized for Kubernetes for functions such as monitoring, logging, and service mesh. 

The following is the list of internalized open sources.

|====================
|Category |Software
|Kubernetes|Kubernetes
|Container Runtime Interface|Cri-o
|Container Storage Interface
|Container Network Interface
|CI/CD|Tekton
|Service Mesh|Istio, Kiali, Jaeger
|Monitoring|Prometheus, Grafana
|Logging|Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana
|====================

{Product-title} {product-version} provides CI/CD environment configuration and deployment environment with improved convenience by internalizing Tekton, the Kubernetes-native open-source framework. It enables service mesh function through Istio internalization, and supports traffic monitoring between services through distributed tracing and topology view.  +

In addition, {product-title} {product-version} provides various self-verified open sources for four categories of middleware/framework, DBMS, big data/AI, and CI/CD by reflecting the market needs for open sources and provides them as the form of service catalogs. Users can easily register and provision based on a template, and registered services can be reused. {product-title} {product-version} not only provides the following 18 types of open source service catalogs, but also optimizes Tmax's advanced solution and provides them as service catalogs. 

== Easy-to use web console

{product-title} {product-version} provides a web console with enhanced user convenience. Basically, it not only provides YAML editor for experienced users, but also provides UI-based form editor so that even beginners who are new to cloud environment can easily use it. In the case of YAML editor, a sample guide is provided so that you can conveniently create YAML. +

Also, {product-title} {product-version} supports multilingual UI. Basically, it supports English, and optionally supports Korean UI for domestic users.
