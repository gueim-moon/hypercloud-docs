== Pod Security Policies

In the main screen of *Pod Security Policies*, you can create and view the `Pod Security Policies` that grant granular permission to create and update Pods.

<2> *Filter by Name* +
Enter the name of the pod security policy you want to search from the list of pod security policies.
<3> *Pod Security Policy List* +
View the list of pod security policies created in the cluster.  +
The following is the description of each item.

|ITEM|Description
|NAME|Name of the pod security policy. Clicking on the name displays a window that allows you to check the detailed information of the pod security policy. +
To delete or update the information about the pod security policy, click

* Edit Labels: Add or delete the labels to identify resources 
* Edit Annotations: Add, update, or delete the annotations that allow external reference to the resources
* Edit Pod Security Policies: Update the configuration information of the pod security policy using the YAML editor
* Delete Pod Security Policies: Delete pod security policies 
|PRIVILEGED|Enable or not the privileged mode. 

* True: Enable
* False: Not enable
|SECURITY-ENHANCED LINUX|Set the range to enable SELinux. 

* MustRunAs: Only the specified range (Range setting required) 
* RunAsAny: All
|RUN AS USER|Range of user IDs allowed to execute containers 

* MustRunAs: Only the specified range (Range setting required)
* MustRunAsNonRoot: Only the users other than Root
* RunAsAny: All
|FILE STORAGE GROUP|Set the range to control supplemental groups applied to some volumes.

* MustRunAs: Only the specified range (Range setting required)

|SUPPLEMENTAL GROUP|Set the range to control the group ID that the container will add.   

* MustRunAs: Only the specified range (Range setting required)
* MayRunAs: Only the specified range if set. All if a range is not set

|CREATED|Time when a pod security policy was created.
|====================

NOTE: Pod security policy control is implemented with an admission controller (recommended). +
When the admission controller is enabled, the pod security policy is applied. 
If you enable the policy without approving it, no pod is generated in the cluster. Therefore, for an existing cluster, it is recommended to add policies and grant permissions before enabling the admission controller. +
After that, you can create a cluster role in the pod security policy created using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), assign the generated cluster role to the service account, and apply the policy.

|POD SELECTOR|Pod range or label information to be managed through network policy.
|====================

NOTE: If there is no network policy, all ingress (inbound) and egress (outbound) traffic to pods in the namespace are allowed. If the namespace has a network policy to select a particular pod, the pod rejects all connections not allowed in that network policy. + 
If one pod is selected for multiple network policies, the ingress and egress rules of the policies are integrated to limit traffic to that pod.
